Notes:
- HR costs are estimated based on market rates for junior-to-mid level profiles
- For student project: Consider HR costs as "opportunity cost" (time invested)
- Infrastructure costs can be reduced significantly using free tiers (Vercel, Netlify, Supabase)
- Adjust quantities and unit costs based on actual team composition and project scope
- CAPEX = Capital Expenditure (one-time investment)
- OPEX = Operational Expenditure (recurring costs)
